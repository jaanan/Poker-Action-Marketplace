### Use cases

Users will have the ability to sell and buy action from other users. Users will have the ability to register and login to the site. Users will only 
see tournaments on the tournament-selling page where they are not the seller since they cannot buy action from themselves. On their private pages 
users will see tournaments where they are selling action for and who has bought action from them, they will also see who they have bought action 
from.
